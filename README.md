# DevNet
This is my capstone project for school.  The idea will be a site for developers to network and share ideas.
There will be a gallery to display You Tube videos of tutorials or demos.
Predictive analytics will be employed to cusomize the site based on the user's profile information.
Java Script framework three.js will be used for 3D graphics effects.
